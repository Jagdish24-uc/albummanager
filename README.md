# Album Manager
The Album Manager is a web application built using React that allows users to manage a collection of albums. Users can view existing albums, add new albums, edit album titles, and delete albums.

## Features
1. View Albums: The application fetches albums from an external API and displays them in a list format.
2. Add Album: Users can add new albums by entering a title for the album.
3. Edit Album: Users can edit the title of an album by clicking on the edit icon, modifying the title, and saving the changes.
4. Delete Album: Users can remove an album from the collection by clicking on the delete icon.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: git clone <repository-url>
2. Navigate to the project directory: cd album-manager
3. Install dependencies: npm install

## Usage
1. Start the application: npm start
2. Open your browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to access the Album Manager.

## API Endpoint
The Album Manager uses the following API endpoint to fetch and manipulate album data:

1. Endpoint: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/albums
2. Methods:
a. GET: Fetches the list of albums.
b. POST: Adds a new album.
c. PUT: Updates an existing album.
d. DELETE: Deletes an album.
Please note that the API provided is a dummy API and does not persist data.

## Dependencies
The Album Manager project relies on the following dependencies:

1. React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
2. FontAwesome: A library of scalable vector icons.
3. CSS: Custom styling for the application.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
